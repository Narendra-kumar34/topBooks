          <h4>By James Clear</h4>
          <p>
            World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler
            system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change
            comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions -
            doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a
            single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.
